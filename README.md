# Weather app

* A weather application I made on my own that can display the weather of any city on the map.

# What I Learned

* This has given me a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Introduced me to APIs and how to use and implement them into web development and JavaScript.

# How to Use 
* This application requires an API key to operate. Please visit https://openweathermap.org/, sign up to obtain your own API key, and replace the existing key in the code.
* User must type in a city for it to show the weather
